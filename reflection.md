- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Victoria - Encapsulation is really helpful for keeping information safe (depending what the program is being used for) and make it safer for programmers and the public to store information. I struggled on understadning Java syntax and its methods, I think my main struggle is remembering everything. I attented TA Hrs (02/23, 7-9pm) and Ab's office hours (02/24, 1:30-3pm) to help me understand how to use some Java mehotds and apply them in the Train class. I would advise other studetns to start early and small, do one class and debug then do another and repeat, and definetly go to TA and/or office hours when you're feeling stuck!

Chiashi Yang - Encapsulation definitely makes programming more secure. Because we are classifying attributes as private, other people who can access the code wonâ€™t be able to modify the attributes. I found the private/public part to be confusing at first, especially with how we are supposed to access the attributes from another class. However, after clarification from Ab, I better understood how the accessors worked and how they can be used in other classes. For instance, in the train class, we have to use the accessor for seats remaining in order to find out the number of seats left across all cars. What worked for our group were the first three classes (engine, car, and passenger). We found those classes easier to implement compared to the train class. Initially, the train class did not work for us. We were confused about how to use the accessors in this class, so it took us a while to figure out how to. Eventually, we were able to figure it out. I would advise people who are taking this course to start on this assignment early and use your resources such as TA hours and office hours. They help immensely!
