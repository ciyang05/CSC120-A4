- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Victoria - Encapsulation is really helpful for keeping information safe (depending what the program is being used for) and make it safer for programmers and the public to store information. I struggled on understadning Java syntax and its methods, I think my main struggle is remembering everything. I attented TA Hrs (02/23, 7-9pm) and Ab's office hours (02/24, 1:30-3pm) to help me understand how to use some Java mehotds and apply them in the Train class. I would advise other studetns to start early and small, do one class and debug then do another and repeat, and definetly go to TA and/or office hours when you're feeling stuck!
